This codes are data work for the Chapter 2 in my Dissertation. 
The main topic is estimate a labor market premium (wage and employment probability) in Kyrgyzstan for male workers who have migration experience.
All codes are done either using python or Stata. 
The data work consist of three parts:
1. Data preparation: Collecting and preparing data using individual micro survey and open source statistics.
2. Data visualisation: Using above prepared data, the visualisations are graphs used in the manuscript.
3. Tables: These are products of estimations (regressions) given as tables used in the manuscript.

The repository has complementary data used in the research. These are data on immigration flow into RF, CPI indexes in KGZ and survey results in return intention of migrants. The main data set is too big to upload (KGZ LiK 2010-2019).

PS: The work is still on going....

Sincerely,
Zukhriddin Juliev
